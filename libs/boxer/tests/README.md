# Tests

## Setup

```bash
pip install pytest pytest-cov scipy
```

`scipy` is only needed as a reference for validating our pure-Python replacements (Hungarian algorithm, connected components).

## Running Tests

From the repo root:

```bash
# Run all tests with coverage report
tests/run_tests.sh

# Run without auto-opening the HTML report
tests/run_tests.sh --no-open

# Run a specific test file
python -m pytest tests/test_fusion.py -v
```

## Coverage

After running `tests/run_tests.sh`, the HTML coverage report is at `tests/htmlcov/index.html`.
